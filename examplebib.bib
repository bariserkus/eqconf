  abstract = {Abstract The dynamic, bi‐linear response behaviour of a series of eight storey shear buildings subjected to simulated earthquake excitation is studied. The specific objective of the investigation is to determine under what conditions a yielding first storey can adequately protect the upper storeys from significant yielding. Two classes of buildings are considered: stiff (0.5 sec period) and flexible (2.0 sec period), and the basic parameters considered in the yielding first storey are the yield force level and the bi‐linear stiffness. The results demonstrate that a very low yield force level and an essentially perfectly plastic yielding mechanism are required in the first storey to provide effective protection to the superstructure. Moreover, the required displacement capacity of such an effective first storey mechanism is found to be very large.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY The nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011 has led the nuclear community to consider seismic isolation for new large light water and small modular reactors to withstand the effects of beyond design basis loadings, including extreme earthquakes. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is sponsoring a research project that will quantify the response of low damping rubber (LDR) and lead rubber (LR) bearings under loadings associated with extreme earthquakes. Under design basis loadings, the response of an elastomeric bearing is not expected to deviate from well‐established numerical models, and bearings are not expected to experience net tension. However, under extended or beyond design basis shaking, elastomer shear strains may exceed 300\% in regions of high seismic hazard, bearings may experience net tension, the compression and tension stiffness will be affected by isolator lateral displacement, and the properties of the lead core in LR bearings will degrade in the short‐term because of substantial energy dissipation. New mathematical models of LDR and LR bearings are presented for the analysis of base isolated structures under design and beyond design basis shaking, explicitly considering both the effects of lateral displacement and cyclic vertical and horizontal loading. These mathematical models extend the available formulations in shear and compression. Phenomenological models are presented to describe the behavior of elastomeric isolation bearings in tension, including the cavitation and post‐cavitation behavior. The elastic mechanical properties make use of the two‐spring model. Strength degradation of LR bearing under cyclic shear loading due to heating of lead core is incorporated. The bilinear area reduction method is used to include variation of critical buckling load capacity with lateral displacement. The numerical models are coded in OpenSees, and the results of numerical analysis are compared with test data. The effect of different parameters on the response is investigated through a series of analyses. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {More than 23,000 structures, located in over 30 countries, have been so far protected by passive anti-seismic (AS) systems, mainly by the seismic isolation (SI) and energy dissipation (ED) ones. The use of such systems is going on increasing everywhere, although its extent is strongly influenced by earthquake lessons and the features of the design rules used. As to the latter, SI is considered as an additional safety measure (with consequent significant additional construction costs) in some countries (Japan, USA, etc.), while, in others (including Italy), the codes allow to partly take into account the reduction of the seismic forces acting on the superstructure that is induced by SI. Applications of the AS systems have been made to both new and existing civil and industrial structures of all kinds. The latter include some high risk (HR) plants (nuclear reactors and chemical installations). The applications in a civil context already include not only strategic and public structures, but also residential buildings and even many small private houses. In Italy, the use of the AS systems has become more and more popular especially after the 2009 Abruzzo earthquake (nowadays more than 400 Italian buildings are seismically isolated). Based on the information provided by the authors at the ASSISi 13th World Conference, held in Sendai (Japan) in September 2013, and on more recent data, the paper summarizes the state-of-the-art of the development and application of the AS systems and devices at worldwide level, by devoting particular attention to SI of buildings in Italy, in the context of recent seismic events. Moreover, it outlines the benefits of the aforesaid systems for ensuring the indispensable absolute integrity of strategic and public structures, as, primarily, schools, hospitals and HR plants, but also (for an adequate protection of cultural heritage) museums. Finally, based on Italian experience, it provides some remarks on costs of SI, stresses the conditions for the correct use of this technique and mentions some recent initiatives of the Italian Parliament to ensure such a correct use and to widely extend such an use to the HR chemical plants too (for which only very few applications already exist in Italy).},

For transient analysis of piping loops under conditions of earthquake and hypothetical accident of pipe rupture, the linear system becomes nonlinear because of forces due to bottoming in gaps, plastic action in the bumper stops or tie rods, etc. The dynamic analysis of such a structure normally employs the direct integration of the governing nonlinear equations of motion. A technique is presented in this paper where conventional normal mode theory is used even though there are nonlinearities. Nonlinearities such as bumper-gap elements, plasticity, etc., are defined as functions of motion and incorporated as generalized pseudoforces. This approach can, to a considerable degree, preserve the benefits of modal type analysis such as physical understanding in terms of frequencies and modes, and adequate and economical solutions using a reduced number of modes.},

  abstract = {In base‐isolated structures specially designed isolation systems provide the needed flexibility and energy dissipation capacity. The isolation systems, which can be either elastomeric or sliding systems, exhibit highly nonlinear behavior. The existing algorithms cannot analyze base‐isolated structures with sliding isolation systems accurately. This paper presents an analytical model and a solution algorithm developed for nonlinear dynamic analysis of three‐dimensional‐base‐isolated structures with elastomeric and/or sliding isolation systems. The novelty of the analytical model and solution algorithm is its capability to capture the highly nonlinear frictional behavior of sliding isolation systems in plane motion. Nonlinear behavior is restricted to the base and the superstructure is considered to be elastic at all times. Biaxial and uniaxial models, which can represent both elastomeric and sliding isolation bearings, are presented. The solution algorithm consisting of the pseudoforce method with iteration is presented. Comparison of computed results with experimental results is presented for verification. A six‐story‐reinforced‐concrete‐base‐isolated structure is analyzed. },

The base isolation system includes both linear and nonlinear bearings and control devices. The superstructure is considered to be a linear elastic system with lateral–torsional behavior. A new nonlinear dynamic analysis program has been developed and made available to facilitate direct comparison of results of different control algorithms. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a sample control design for the base-isolated benchmark building with bilinear hysteretic bearings (e.g. lead–rubber bearings). Since there is no well-defined control strategy for nonlinear structures, and available linear strategies are well-known among the civil engineering community, a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is selected for this purpose. To utilize an LQG controller, a linearized model of the nonlinear structure is required. A good linearized model, however, should be able to represent the nonlinear structure responses when both are controlled. It is shown that design problems of an equivalent linear model and an LQG controller are not, in fact, independent and require one for the other. In this study, the LQG controller is designed based on some parametric studies, and an iterative method is proposed for the development of an equivalent linear model. In the iterative method, the equivalent linear model is formed by replacing the nonlinear isolation elements that have bilinear stiffness and zero damping in the benchmark structure with a linear stiffness and a linear damping. Here, the linear stiffness is determined in the iterative method such that the RMS force of the bilinear isolation elements in the controlled (nonlinear) benchmark structure is equivalent to that of the corresponding isolation elements in the equivalent linear model. The overall approach is applied to the benchmark structure for seven historical earthquake ground acceleration data, and both an LQG controller and an equivalent linear model are obtained. The numerical simulations show that the equivalent linear model successfully replicates the nonlinear response, and the controller is able to improve the overall performance. As the final designs are not intended to be competitive, the method proposed can be improved in several ways to obtain better results. While the equivalent linear model developed herein may be used as a starting point in studying this benchmark problem, because of the strong interaction between controller and equivalent linear model, the participants of the base isolation benchmark problem are strongly encouraged to develop their own controller-specific equivalent linear models.

  abstract = {Abstract It is clear that base isolation is a sensible strategic design in attenuating the responses of a structural system induced by ground motions. The design of seismically isolated structures is mainly governed by the Uniform Building Code (UBC) published by the International Conference of Building Officials. The UBC code emphasizes a simple, statically equivalent design method that displacements of an isolated structure are concentrated at the isolation level. Therefore, the superstructure nearly moves as a rigid body and the design forces of elements above isolators are based on the behaviour of isolators at the design displacement. However, in the UBC code, the distribution of inertial (or lateral) forces over the height of the superstructure above isolation has been found to be too conservative for most isolated structures. In view of this, two simple and reasonable design formulae for the lateral force distribution on isolated structures have been proposed in this paper. Results obtained from a full-scale isolated structure tested on the shaking table and numerical analyses of two additional examples verify the suitability of design formulae. It is illustrated that the proposed formulae can predict well the lateral force distribution on isolated structures during earthquakes. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {It has been pointed out that the static lateral response procedure for a base isolated structure presented in UBC-97 somewhat overestimates the seismic story force. In this study the UBC-91 and UBC-97 static lateral load procedures for isolated structures are investigated, and a new formula is proposed for the vertical distribution of seismic load. The formula is derived by combining the fundamental mode shape of the isolated structure idealized as two degrees of freedom system and the fundamental mode shape of a fixed-based structure. The seismic story forces resulting from the proposed method are compared with those obtained from dynamic time history analysis and the code procedures. The results show that the proposed method provides conservative results compared with those from dynamic analysis and UBC-91 approach, and produces a more economic solution compared with the UBC-97 static lateral response procedure.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for the evaluation of accurate lateral force distributions for the Linear Static Analysis (LSA) of Base Isolated (BI-) buildings. In essence, the proposed lateral force distributions depend on a factor measuring the degree of non- linearity of the Isolation System (IS) and on the ratio between the effective period of the BI-structure (Tis) and the fundamental period of the Fixed Based (FB-) structure (Tfb). The proposed approach is fully compatible with the Direct Displacement-Based Design (DDBD) method, recently developed by Priestley and co-workers. The proposed lateral force distributions have been derived from the results of a large number of Nonlinear Time-History Analyses (NTHA), carried out on six numerical models of multi-storey buildings, differing in storey number (3, 5 and 8, respectively) and fundamental period of vibration (from 0.25 to 0.8 s) in the fixed-base configuration. A great variety of Isolation Systems (ISs), characterised by either Elasto-Plastic with Hardening (EPH) or Flag-Shaped (FS) force-displacement behaviour, have been considered in the NTHA. The numerical parameters of the IS models have been varied in such a way as to reproduce the actual mechanical behaviour of the main currently used ISs, including: (i) Lead Rubber Bearings (LRB), (ii) High-Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRB), (iii) Friction Pendulum Bearings (FPB), (iv) combinations of flat Sliding Bearings (SB) and Low-Damping Rubber Bearings (LDRB) and (v) Combinations of flat SB and re-centring devices based on Shape Memory Alloys (SMA). Comparisons between the storey shear forces derived with the proposed method and those obtained from NTHA clearly show the great improvements in the accuracy of LSA predictions, when using the proposed lateral force distributions.},
